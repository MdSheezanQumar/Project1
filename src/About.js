        <h3>Introduction & Quick Facts</h3>
        <p>India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. India is made up
             of 28 states and eight union territories, and its national capital is New Delhi,
              built in the 20th century just south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to serve as 
              India’s administrative centre. Its government is a constitutional republic that represents 
              a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and hundreds of languages. 
              India became the world’s most populous country in 2023, according to estimates by the United 
              Nations..It is the seventh-largest and most populous country in the world, with 
            a rich and diverse history of human settlement, culture and religion.</p>


            <p>It is known from archaeological evidence that a highly sophisticated urbanized
                 culture—the Indus civilization—dominated the northwestern part of the subcontinent 
                 from about 2600 to 2000 BCE. From that period on, India functioned as a virtually 
                 self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise to a distinctive tradition
                  that was associated primarily with Hinduism, the roots of which can largely be traced
                   to the Indus civilization. Other religions, notably Buddhism and Jainism, originated 
                   in India—though their presence there is now quite small—and throughout the centuries 
                   residents of the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as 
                   mathematics, astronomy, architecture, literature, music, and the fine arts.</p>

             <p>Throughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed by incursions from
                 beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially important was the coming of Islam,
                  brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders beginning 
                  early in the 8th century CE. Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th 
                  century much of the subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims
                   steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da 
                   Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in 
                   the region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea,
                    a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption 
                    of the subcontinent within the British Empire.</p> 

             <h3>Land</h3>

             <p>India’s frontier, which is roughly one-third coastline, abuts six countries. It is
                 bounded to the northwest by Pakistan, to the north by Nepal, China, and Bhutan; and to
                  the east by Myanmar (Burma). Bangladesh to the east is surrounded by India to the north,
                   east, and west. The island country of Sri Lanka is situated some 40 miles (65 km) off the 
                   southeast coast of India across the Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar</p> 

             <p>The land of India—together with Bangladesh and most of Pakistan—forms a well-defined subcontinent,
                 set off from the rest of Asia by the imposing northern mountain rampart of the Himalayas and by 
                 adjoining mountain ranges to the west and east. In area, India ranks as the seventh largest country
                  in the world.</p> 

               <h3>Economy</h3>    

               <p>India has one of the largest, most highly diversified economies in the world, but, because
                 of its enormous population, it is—in terms of income and gross national product (GNP) per 
                 capita—one of the poorest countries on Earth. Since independence, India has promoted a mixed 
                 economic system in which the government, constitutionally defined as “socialist,” plays a major 
                 role as central planner, regulator, investor, manager, and producer. Starting in 1951, the government 
                 based its economic planning on a series of five-year plans influenced by the Soviet model. Initially, 
                 the attempt was to boost the domestic savings rate, which more than doubled in the half century 
                 following the First Five-Year Plan (1951–55). With the Second Five-Year Plan (1956–61), the focus
                  began to shift to import-substituting industrialization, with an emphasis on capital goods. A broad 
                  and diversified industrial base developed. However, with the collapse of the Soviet system in the early 
                  1990s, India adopted a series of free-market reforms that fueled the growth of its middle class, and its
                   highly educated and well-trained workforce made India one of the global centres of the high-technology 
                   boom that began in the late 20th century and produced significant annual growth rates. The agricultural
                    sector remains the country’s main employer (about half of the workforce), though, with about one-fifth
                     of the gross domestic product (GDP), it is no longer the largest contributor to GDP. Manufacturing 
                     remains another solid component of GDP. However, the major growth has been in trade, finance, and other
                      services, which, collectively, are by far the largest component of GDP.</p>        

                   <h3>History of India</h3>   

                   <p>The Indian subcontinent, the great landmass of South Asia, is the home of one of the world’s oldest and 
                    most influential civilizations. In this article, the subcontinent, which for historical purposes is usually
                     called simply “India,” is understood to comprise the areas of not only the present-day Republic of India 
                     (free from British rule since August 15, 1947, celebrated as the country’s Independence Day) but also the
                      republics of Pakistan (partitioned from India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which formed the eastern part of 
                      Pakistan until its independence in 1971). For the histories of these latter two countries since their 
                      creation, see Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>   

                   <p>Since early times the Indian subcontinent appears to have provided an attractive habitat for human 
                    occupation. Toward the south it is effectively sheltered by wide expanses of ocean, which tended to 
                    isolate it culturally in ancient times, while to the north it is protected by the massive ranges of 
                    the Himalayas, which also sheltered it from the Arctic winds and the air currents of Central Asia. Only
                     in the northwest and northeast is there easier access by land, and it was through those two sectors that
                      most of the early contacts with the outside world took place.</p>
